# Contributing

First, thank you for contributing! We love and encourage pull requests from everyone. 

- If you have trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a [pull request][prs], for time being mention me to review the changes.
- If you plan to do major changes, here are few guidelines to follow:
    1. Check the [open issues][issues] and [pull requests][prs] for existing discussions.
    1. Open an [issue][issues] first, to discuss new feature or enhancement.
    1. Write the code with tests, and make sure it passes locally and on CI.
    1. Open a pull request, and reference the relevant issue(s).
    1. After receiving feedback, [squash your commits][squash] and add a [great commit message][message].
