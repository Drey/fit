# Fit SDK for Go
The Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer (FIT) protocol is a protocol developed by Garmin for storing and sharing data originating from sports, fitness, and health devices. 
When recording an activity using devices such as cycling computer, smartwatch, and more, chances are the resulting file is often in FIT format (*.fit). 
The FIT file is a binary file format known for its compact size, making it the preferred choice for manufacturers to be used in their embedded devices. 
However, despite having gained widespread adoption, Garmin has not yet released an official SDK for Go, this is where this SDK comes in to bridge the gap, enabling Go developers to be able to interact with FIT file format.

This SDK is designed with efficiency in mind, but it places a higher priority on clarity, simplicity and extensibility.
